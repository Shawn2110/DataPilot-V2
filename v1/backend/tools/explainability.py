Tool 8: Explainability (SHAP)

Answers the most important question: WHY did the model make this prediction?

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values come from game theory.
The idea: each feature is a "player" in a game. SHAP tells you how much
each player (feature) contributed to the final prediction.

Example — predicting house prices:
  Base prediction: $300,000 (average house price)
  SHAP values:
    +$50,000  (5 bedrooms → pushes price up)
    +$30,000  (good neighborhood → pushes price up)
    -$20,000  (small lot → pushes price down)
    -$10,000  (old roof → pushes price down)
  Final prediction: $350,000

SHAP explainer types:
  - TreeExplainer: for tree-based models (RF, XGBoost, LightGBM) — FAST
  - LinearExplainer: for linear models (Logistic/Linear Regression) — FAST
  - KernelExplainer: for any model — SLOW (we avoid this)

Why sample 100 rows?
  SHAP computation is O(n * features * 2^features) in the worst case.
  Even TreeExplainer can be slow on large datasets. 100 rows gives
  a representative picture without waiting 10 minutes.
