Tool 5: Feature Engineering

Creates new features from existing ones to help models find patterns.

What it does:
  1. Interaction features: multiply pairs of important features together
     e.g., "height × weight" might be more predictive than either alone
  2. Variance filter: remove features with near-zero variance
     (if a feature is almost the same value everywhere, it can't help prediction)

Why feature engineering?
  Raw features often aren't enough. A model predicting house prices might
  benefit from "price_per_sqft" (price / area) more than price or area alone.
  Feature engineering gives the model better "ingredients" to work with.

Why NOT polynomial features?
  Polynomial features (x², x³, x*y) can explode the number of features.
  With 10 features, degree-2 polynomial creates 65 features.
  With 50 features, it creates 1,325. This causes overfitting and slowness.
  We only create interactions for the top correlated feature pairs.
