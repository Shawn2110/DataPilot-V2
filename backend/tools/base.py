base.py — Base class for all pipeline tools.

LangChain tools work by:
  1. The agent reads each tool's name + description
  2. Based on the current task, the agent decides which tool to call
  3. LangChain calls the tool's _run() method with the agent's input
  4. The tool returns a string result
  5. The agent reads the result and decides what to do next (ReAct loop)

Our tools also need access to the shared PipelineState.
We solve this by storing a reference to the state in each tool instance.
This way, tools can both read from and write to the shared state.

The `args_schema` tells LangChain what input the tool expects.
LangChain validates the input before calling _run().
