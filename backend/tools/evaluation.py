Tool 7: Model Evaluation

Tests the best model on the held-out test set (data the model has NEVER seen).

Why a separate test set?
  Cross-validation gives us an estimate, but the model was still trained
  on all the training data. The test set is completely untouched data.
  If the model performs well here, we can be confident it will work on
  real-world data too.

  If test performance is much worse than CV performance → overfitting.
  (The model memorized training data instead of learning patterns.)

Classification metrics:
  - Accuracy: % of correct predictions (misleading for imbalanced data!)
  - Precision: of all positive predictions, how many were correct?
  - Recall: of all actual positives, how many did we catch?
  - F1 Score: harmonic mean of precision and recall (balanced metric)
  - ROC-AUC: area under the ROC curve (how well model separates classes)
  - Confusion Matrix: table showing correct vs incorrect predictions

Regression metrics:
  - MAE: average absolute error (in same units as target)
  - RMSE: root mean squared error (penalizes large errors more)
  - R²: how much variance the model explains (1.0 = perfect, 0 = useless)
