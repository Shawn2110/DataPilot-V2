Tool 6: Model Training & Comparison

Trains 4 models, evaluates them with cross-validation, and picks the best.

Models for Classification:
  1. Logistic Regression — simple, fast, interpretable (the "baseline")
  2. Random Forest — ensemble of decision trees (good default)
  3. XGBoost — gradient boosting (often wins competitions)
  4. LightGBM — Microsoft's gradient boosting (fast + memory efficient)

Models for Regression:
  1. Linear Regression — the simplest possible model
  2. Random Forest Regressor
  3. XGBoost Regressor
  4. LightGBM Regressor

Cross-validation explained:
  Instead of training once and hoping for the best, we:
  1. Split training data into 5 "folds"
  2. For each fold: train on 4 folds, evaluate on the held-out fold
  3. Average the 5 scores → this is a robust estimate of model quality
  4. Pick the model with the highest mean CV score

  Fold 1: [TEST] [train] [train] [train] [train]  → score 0.92
  Fold 2: [train] [TEST] [train] [train] [train]  → score 0.90
  Fold 3: [train] [train] [TEST] [train] [train]  → score 0.91
  Fold 4: [train] [train] [train] [TEST] [train]  → score 0.93
  Fold 5: [train] [train] [train] [train] [TEST]  → score 0.89
  Mean: 0.91, Std: 0.015

Why save the best model as .joblib?
  So we can load it later for predictions without retraining.
  joblib is optimized for large numpy arrays inside sklearn models.
